Map => The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

-> The result of a call to the map function can be saved a brand new array.
Map() takes a function as an arguments.
1. The function receives each item of the original array one by one.
2. Each return from the function becomes an item of the new array.


Filter => The filter() method of Array instances creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.


reduce =>The reduce() method of Array instances executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
