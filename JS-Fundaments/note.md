1. What is JavaScript?

Js is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.

It's growing as fast as python.

-> Giants like netflix, walmart, and paypal are building entire applications around js.


2. What can you do with javascript?

-> Add interactivity to webpages
-> Make full web/mobile apps with js
-> Desktop applications
-> Real-time networking application
-> Command-line tools
-> Games
-> Backend Services
-> Databases


3. Where does js code run?

-> js was originally designed to run only in client-side browsers


-> browsers and node provide a runtime environment for our js code.

4. What is the difference between js and ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is just a specification. Js is a programming language that conforms to the specifications.

An organization called ECMA is responsible for defining standards.

1997 Started
2015 -> ES6(Many new features)
2016 -> ES7
2017 -> ES8

5. What is a Variables?

We use variables to store data temporarily in the computer's memory. we store the data somewhere and give it a name, with this name, we can read the stored data in the future.

variable - box
data(value) = what we put inside the box
variable name = lable that we put on the box

-> 3 ways to declare a variable - var , let , const

// 3 ways to declare a varoables - var, let, const
var firstName; // Declaretion and auto-initialization
firstName = "Kajal"; //Assignment
console.log(firstName);

Rules=>
1. Variables name cannot contain spaces.

2. variables names must begin with a letter, an underscores(_) or a dollar sign($)

3. Variables names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

4. variables names are case-sensitive.

5. Certain words may not be used as variables names, because they have other meanings within js.

6. What all type of value can be assigned to variables?

=> Primitives(value type)

String
number
boolean
undefined
null
bigint
symbol

=> Non-Primitives (Reference types)

Object
arrays
function

-> Dynamic Typing

Using the typeof operator to check types & charge them dynamically.


1. Object => Object in a programming language are like an object in a real-world. An object has properties. An Object is simply a group of related variables.

ways to access properties:
-> dot notation
-> bracket notation


2. Array => An array is used to store a list of objects.

3. Functions => Function is a set of statements that either  perform a task or calculates and returns a value.

A function is a set of statements in js which is

-> Callable (Executable)
-> It can take arguments
-> has a set of statements that can either perform tasks or calculations
-> return a value

7. What is an Operators

we use operators to create expressions.

An expressions is something that performs some calculations and return a value.

1. Arithmetic 
2. Assignment
3. Comparision
4. Logical
5. Bitwise
6. Ternary
